This is definitely achievable with Supabase! The system would automatically send beautifully formatted emails to all your users whenever you publish a new blog post, and you'll get detailed analytics on how many people open the emails, click through to read the articles, and engage with your content.

The tracking system will give you insights like:

Open rates: How many users actually open your emails
Click-through rates: How many click to read the full article
Engagement metrics: Time spent reading, device types used
Geographic data: Where your most engaged readers are located
Subscription health: Track unsubscribes and preferences
Would you like me to implement this email newsletter system with tracking? The setup involves integrating with Resend.com for email delivery, creating the tracking infrastructure, and building the admin interface for monitoring performance.
