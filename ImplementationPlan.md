# üöÄ Ask2Query - Loveable Implementation Plan

## üìã **Implementation Strategy**

Each prompt builds on the previous one. Run them in order, test each step, then move to the next.

---

## üéØ **PROMPT 1: Project Setup & Basic UI**

```
Create a React app called "Ask2Query" for converting natural language to SQL queries. 

Requirements:
- Modern, clean UI with TailwindCSS
- Header with "Ask2Query" logo and tagline "Turn English into SQL"
- Main input area with large text box for natural language queries
- Placeholder text: "Ask anything about your data... (e.g., 'Show top 3 customers by revenue')"
- Primary button labeled "Generate SQL"
- Dark/light mode toggle in header
- Responsive design that works on mobile
- Use a modern color scheme (dark blue/purple gradient)

The layout should be:
1. Header with logo, tagline, and theme toggle
2. Hero section with main input box and generate button
3. Footer with "Built for FutureHack! A.I. Battlefield 2025"

Make it look professional and hackathon-ready.
```

## üîß **PROMPT 2: Add OpenAI Integration**

```
Add OpenAI GPT-4 API integration to the existing Ask2Query app.

Requirements:

    signup_date DATE,
    country TEXT
);

-- products table  
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2)

## üìù **USAGE INSTRUCTIONS**

1. **Start with Prompt 1** - Get the basic UI working
2. **Test each step** - Make sure it works before moving on
3. **Customize as needed** - Adjust styling/features based on your preferences
4. **Skip prompts if needed** - You can skip non-essential features if running short on time
5. **Focus on demo** - Prioritize features that will look good in your 3-minute pitch

## üéØ **HACKATHON PRIORITY ORDER**

**Must Have (Day 1):**
- Prompts 1-3: Basic UI and SQL generation

**Should Have (Day 2):**
- Prompts 4-6: File upload, real database execution, and results display

**Nice to Have (Day 3):**
- Prompts 7-10: Dynamic schema browser, history, and polish

## üèÜ **DEMO PREPARATION**

After completing the core prompts (1-6), you'll have a fully functional demo. The later prompts add polish and advanced features that can wow the judges but aren't essential for the core functionality.

Remember: **Better to have a simple, working solution than a complex, broken one!**
